## Summary

This python script can be easily modified to analyze and audit any type of elections. Here are two examples of how this script can be modified and used:
- If we needed to analysis a federal congressional election, we would just need to change the counties to states.
- If we had a statewide or local initiative election, we would just need to change candidates to in favor or against.
